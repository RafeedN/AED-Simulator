# Automated External Defibrillator(AED) Plus Simulator

## Project Context
The project involves **designing** and **developing** a software simulation of the **AED Plus** (Automated External Defibrillator Plus) system in **C++** using the **Qt** framework. The AED Plus is a critical medical device used in emergencies, specifically for individuals experiencing cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. It automatically diagnoses these life-threatening conditions and administers defibrillation to restore normal heart rhythm. The software simulation aims to replicate the core functionality of the AED Plus, including **cardiac rhythm analysis**, **shock delivery**, **CPR guidance**, and **real-time feedback**, providing users with an interactive platform to understand and practice emergency response procedures.

## Learning Goals Achieved
**1. Software Design and Documentation:**
Created comprehensive design documentation including UML Class diagrams, Sequence diagrams, and State diagrams, elucidating the structure and behavior of the software simulation.
Made informed design decisions documented through textual explanations, reflecting a deep understanding of system architecture and requirements.
**2. Implementation Proficiency:**
Developed a fully functional Qt C++ project that replicates AED Plus functionality, ensuring compatibility and smooth operation on the designated course VM.
Implemented rigorous testing procedures based on specified design scenarios, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the software solution.
**3. User Interaction and Interface Design:**
Designed an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) resembling the AED Plus display, facilitating user interaction and enhancing usability.
Integrated visual elements to display real-time CPR feedback, cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis results, and device status indicators, enhancing user experience and engagement.
**4. Simulation of Medical Device Functionality:**
Simulated cardiac arrhythmia detection algorithms, accurately replicating the AED's capability to diagnose shockable and non-shockable rhythms.
Implemented real-time CPR feedback mechanisms, providing users with actionable guidance on chest compressions to improve resuscitation efficacy.
**5. Teamwork and Collaboration:**
Successfully collaborated within a team of three, demonstrating effective communication, task allocation, and coordination throughout the project lifecycle.
Leveraged collective skills and expertise to overcome challenges, ensuring timely delivery of project milestones and achieving high-quality results.
