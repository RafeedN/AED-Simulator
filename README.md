# Automated External Defibrillator(AED) Plus Simulator

## Project Context
The project involves designing and developing a software simulation of the **AED Plus** (Automated External Defibrillator Plus) system. The AED Plus is a critical medical device used in emergencies, specifically for individuals experiencing cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. It automatically diagnoses these life-threatening conditions and administers defibrillation to restore normal heart rhythm. The software simulation aims to replicate the core functionality of the AED Plus, including **cardiac rhythm analysis**, **shock delivery**, **CPR guidance**, and **real-time feedback**, providing users with an interactive platform to understand and practice emergency response procedures.
